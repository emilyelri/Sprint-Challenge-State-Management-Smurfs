1. What problem does the context API help solve?

[ ]   Makes state accessible throughout the app w/o prop drilling

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

[ ]  actions - handlers to determine which function to activate in a reducer
[ ]  reducer - returns a new state object
[ ]  store - state object

3. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

[ ]  app state - app-wide state
[ ]  comp state - state local to one component only

4. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

[ ]  redux-thunk allows reducers to operate async

5. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

[ ]  Once i got the hang of redux, it became my favorite because it is a really concise way to tie everything together. A lot of boilerplate, though.
